<table>
<tbody><tr><th>QUERY   </th><th>NAME/DESCRIPTION
</th></tr><tr valign="TOP"><td>00      </td><td>RESUME<br>
	A "WILL RESUME" request indicates that this file is a static file
	that can be resumed later if the transfer doesn't complete.  If a
	client would like to resume a previously disconnected transfer,
	it should send "DO RESUME" -- otherwise it should reply with
	"DON'T RESUME".  There is one 4-byte parameter to a "WILL RESUME"
	request: the timestamp of the file, in network byte order, measured
	in standard epoch seconds (the number of seconds that have passed
	since midnight on 1 January 1970, GMT).  This may be used by the
	recipient client to assure that the file has not been modified
	since the disconnected transfer.  There is also one 4-byte parameter
	to a "DO RESUME" request: the offset, in network byte order, that
	the transfer should be resumed from.  This offset is measured in
	bytes from the beginning of the file -- hence, a value of "0"
	indicates that the client wishes to receive the file from the
	beginning.<br>
	Parameters: (request:) 4-byte timestamp (reply:) 4-byte offset<br>
	Example: (request:) FB 00 04 33 CD 53 16<br>
		 (reply:) FD 00 04 00 00 04 00
</td></tr><tr valign="TOP"><td>01      </td><td>PLAYABLE<br>
        A "DO PLAYABLE" request indicates that this file is intended to be
        triggered by a CTCP PLAY request later.  Clients should only activate
        files sent with "DO PLAYABLE" when honoring a CTCP PLAY request.
        The reply to the "DO PLAYABLE" request (WILL/WON'T) may be ignored.
        A client should reply "WILL" if it supports CTCP PLAY and intends
        to honor a future CTCP PLAY request for this file.  It should reply
        "WON'T" if it doesn't support CTCP PLAY and/or doesn't intent to
	honor future CTCP PLAY requests for this file.<br>
	Parameters: none.<br>
	Example: FD 01 00
</td></tr><tr valign="TOP"><td>02      </td><td>PLAY-NOW<br>
        A "DO PLAY-NOW" request indicates that this file should be "played"
        after the file tranmission is complete.  The definition of "play"
        will vary according to the file type, but should match the behavior
        of a CTCP PLAY request.  A client may request "DO PLAY-NOW" without
        "DO PLAYABLE" -- this means the client would like the file to be
        activated upon receipt, and that no future CTCP PLAY request will be
        made for this file.  The reply to the "DO PLAY-NOW" request may be
        ignored.  A client should reply "WILL" if it intends to activate
        the file after transmission is complete, and "WON'T" if it doesn't.<br>
	Parameters: none.<br>
	Example: FD 02 00
</td></tr><tr valign="TOP"><td>10	</td><td>ENCRYPT<br>
	"WILL ENCRYPT" is a request to negotiate encryption protocols.  Only
	the initiating client may send a "WILL ENCRYPT" request.  The
	recipient client may choose one encryption method and respond with
	"DO ENCRYPT", or may refuse encryption and respond with "DON'T
	ENCRYPT".  The parameters to a "WILL ENCRYPT" request should be a
	series of one-byte codes representing encryption methods.  There
	must be one parameter to a "DO ENCRYPT" request: the encryption
	method chosen.  If the clients agree to encrypt the session, the
	encryption begins after option negotiation is completed.<br>
	Parameters: encryption methods (one byte each).<br>
	Example: (request:) FB 10 02 00 01 (reply:) FD 10 01 01
